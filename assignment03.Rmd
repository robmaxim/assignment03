## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r loadplots, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r read_data}
IPEDS <- read_csv("IPEDS_data.csv")
```

```{r rename_variables, echo = FALSE}
IPEDS <- IPEDS %>%
  rename(enrollment_2018 = 'Grand total (EFFY2018  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2017 = 'Grand total (EFFY2017  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2016 = 'Grand total (EFFY2016  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2015 = 'Grand total (EFFY2015  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2014 = 'Grand total (EFFY2014  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2013 = 'Grand total (EFFY2013  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2012 = 'Grand total (EFFY2012  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2011 = 'Grand total (EFFY2011  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2010 = 'Grand total (EFFY2010  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(enrollment_2009 = 'Grand total (EFFY2009  Undergraduate)') %>%
  rename(state_abbrev = 'State abbreviation (HD2017)') %>%
  rename(state_tuition_2017 = 'Total price for in-state students living on campus 2017-18 (DRVIC2017)') %>%
  rename(applicants_2017 = 'Applicants total (ADM2017)') %>%
  rename(admissions_2017 = 'Admissions total (ADM2017)') %>%
  rename(SAT_math_2017 = 'SAT Math 75th percentile score (ADM2017)')
